# blocklist
A Linux script to download and block IP ranges.

The script downloads the ads and spyware blocklists obtained from iblocklist.com and blocks using Linux IPtables and the IPset extension.
Also includes Systemd startup startup and timer scripts so that the blocklist can be enabled on startup, and routinely updated for server environments.
