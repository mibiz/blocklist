# blocklist
A Linux script to download and block IP ranges.

The script downloads blocklists for ads and spyware obtained from iblocklist.com and blocks using Linux IPtables and the IPset extension.
Also includes Systemd startup and timer scripts so that the blocklist can be enabled on startup, and routinely updated for server environments.
